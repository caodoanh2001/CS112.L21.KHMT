        "An article has a citation score of **c** if it is cited **c** times in the works of other scientists. One of the ways to evaluate a scientist's success is to calculate the **H_Index** impact index based on the combination of the number of articles and the citation index of those articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "A scientist's **H_Index** is maximum of **k** if he or she has **k** articles, each with a citation score of not less than **k**. For example, if a person has 10 articles, each of which is cited no less than 10 times, that person's **H_Index** is at least equal to 10.\n",
