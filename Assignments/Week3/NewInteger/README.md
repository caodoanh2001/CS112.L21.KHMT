# New Integer

## Problem

Let a positive integer n have no more than 100 digits. Find the largest integer m is divisible by 3 and differs from n by exactly one digit.

Input from standard input device:

Data: Input a positive integer n have no more than 100 digits which don't have meaningless 0 digits. 

Example:


<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Input</td>
<td>Output</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><tt>123</tt></p>
</td>
<td>723</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Abstraction



## Pattern Recognition

Brutal Force

## Algorithm designed

The main idea is search all solutions that divisible by 3 and and differs from n by exactly one digit. After that, we put these into a list and find the largest solution.
